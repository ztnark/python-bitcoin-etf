Description
A very simple python script that checks two SEC website for updates on the Bitcoin ETF. One is their main public facing website. The other is an ftp server they expose for unknown reasons. The times of historical release have not been aligned, this is why checking both is a good idea.

Tired of pressing "F5" all day waiting for an update from the SEC before March 11th 2017? This simple script will automate that process for you and tell whether or not there has been an update on the Bitcoin ETF, plus you'll be emailed.
